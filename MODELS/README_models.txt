- The "choXXX.mat" files were used to generate Figure 2C using experimental uptakes from Selvarasu (see below)

- The file "experimental_constraints.mat" contains uptake/secretion rates from 4 different studies

- The file "Kallehauge_DG44_model.mat" was used to generate Figure 4

- choIgG_05, choIgG_50, choIgG_100 are models secreting IgG with varying values of the Kv parameter

-tpa_DSBh, tpa_NGh, tpa_OGh are iCHO2048s models secreting tPA with an excessive number of Post-translational modifications
Results from these 4 models are shown in Excel file "Comparison between tpa models"
